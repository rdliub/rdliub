# Features!
Our code essentially is a proof concept of our smart contract built on the Etherum platform. When compiled and properly running on your local server you will be able to withdraw, deposit and check a temporary ETH balance. We also have a simple proof of concept for the token that will be powering our service. 

  - Ability to interact with our ETH smart contract.
  - Simple HTML interface.
  - Buildr token generation and exchange
